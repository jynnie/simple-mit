            <h3>Want to send to a mailing list but exclude someone?</h3>

            <p>Now, for the next birthday email or surprise party,
            just do one of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><addr>{safetythird}-{michaelx}@simple.mit.edu: </addr> send to everyone in safetythird except michaelx.</li>
                <li><addr>safetythird--kyc2915@simple.mit.edu: </addr> note that without curly braces, you need two minus signs!</li>
                <li><addr>safetythird-minus-dyhwong@simple.mit.edu: </addr> the verbose way.</li>
                <li><addr>{safetythird}-{dyhwong}.mitonly@simple.mit.edu: </addr> don't worry about inadvertently sending to an alternate Gmail on the list and ruining the surprise -- filter for '@mit' addresses only!</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Important:</b> you must address your email to <b><i>simple.mit.edu</i></b>, not mit.edu.</p>

            <p>You can use this syntax for both a list minus a kerberos, as well as a list minus another list.
            You can even exclude multiple email addresses and lists!</p>

            <p>But wait! SIMPLE can do more. Keep reading to find out what else you can do with SIMPLE.</p>

            <h3>Syntax Details</h3>

            <p>Currently three operations are supported: minus (-), plus (+) and intersect (&amp;). An
            example for syntax is best shown with a table:

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Braces notation</th>
                    <th>Quick notation</th>
                    <th>Verbose notation</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>minus (everyone except Tom Riddle): </td>
                    <td><addr>{safetythird}-{tomriddle}@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                    <td><addr>safetythird--tomriddle@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                    <td><addr>safetythird-minus-tomriddle@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>plus (BC and Next): </td>
                    <td><addr>{bc-talk}+{next-forum}@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                    <td><addr>bc-talk++next-forum@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                    <td><addr>bc-talk-plus-next-forum@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>intersect (safetythird 2017s): </td>
                    <td><addr>{safetythird}&amp;{mit2017}@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                    <td><addr>safetythird&amp;&amp;mit2017@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                    <td><addr>safetythird-intersect-mit2017@simple.mit.edu</addr></td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>You can chain operations together, and they will be evaluated from left to right. For
            example, <addr>safetythird--tomriddle++bc-talk&&mit2017@simple.mit.edu</addr> will take the
            members of safetythird, remove Tom Riddle, add everyone from BC, and finally from those
            emails filter out only the members of the class of 2017.</p>

            <p>The braces notation also supports nested expressions. For example,
            <addr>{safetythird}-{{{tomriddle}+{bc-talk}}&mit2017}@simple.mit.edu</addr> will first take
            Tom Riddle, add the members of bc-talk, and from those take only the members of mit2017.
            Then your email will be sent to everyone in safetythird not in that list.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Dry Runs</h3>

            <p>You may be unsure about whether a given email will actually be parsed in the same way
            that you think it will. If you have doubts, you can always submit a <i>dry run</i> email
            to SIMPLE containing the email that you want to test. Just append '.dryrun' to the end of
            the email, before the '@' sign:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                <p>send to <addr>{safetythird}-{michaelx}.dryrun@simple.mit.edu</addr></p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The above email will send you a message specifying how SIMPLE will parse the email,
            without actually sending the email to anyone.</p>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                <h4>Can I just type <b>@mit.edu</b>, instead of <b>@simple.mit.edu</b>?</h4>
                <p>Sorry, we run a separate email server that parses the emails, so you must
                go through SIMPLE.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>My emails didn't send to anyone.</h4>
                <p>You can first try to submit a dry run email to see if the SIMPLE server is
                running correctly. Also, verify that you did not receive an error message
                email, possibly in your spam folder.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Can I exclude multiple people?</h4>
                <p>Yes, just send to something of the form <addr>{list}-{user1}-{user2}@simple.mit.edu</addr>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4> My stealthy friend has their non-MIT (e.g. Gmail) address on a mailing list. How can I still exclude them?</h4>
                <p>Fear not! Just append '.mitonly' to the end of the email address, before the '@' sign. For example, sending to <addr>{safetythird}-{dyhwong}.mitonly@simple.mit.edu</addr> will send only to valid '@mit' addresses on safetythird, except 'dyhwong@mit.edu'</p>
                <h4>Can I put SIMPLE emails in mailing lists?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely. However, MIT's mailing list server does not seem to handle the curly braces in
                <addr>{list}-{user}@simple.mit.edu</addr> correctly, so please use either quick
                notation (<addr>list--user@simple.mit.edu</addr>) or verbose notation
                (<addr>list-minus-user@simple.mit.edu</addr>) instead when using SIMPLE emails in mailing lists.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Can I cc or bcc a SIMPLE email?</h4>
                <p>Yes, a SIMPLE email is just like a normal email address.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>Can I send to a hidden list?</h4>
                <p>Yes, provided you have the permissions to view the members of the list. If so, send your email
                as you normally would, through SIMPLE. SIMPLE will then send you an activation link, which will
                ask you to login through Webathena and complete the sending process.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>I have a question that is not on this list.</h4>
                <p>Please ask us at <addr>admin@simple.mit.edu</addr>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                <p><i>11/6/2014:</i> Added a script to allow administrators of hidden lists to send

                    <li>
                    <p><i>12/15/2013:</i> SIMPLE does not support mailman lists, but sometimes when users
                    use a mailman list, an uninformative error about empty intersections shows up. We have
                    fixed this error message to clarify that the error is the usage of the mailman list.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><i>12/14/2013:</i> We discovered a bug where on days that SIMPLE is
                    being used too much, some emails are not sent. We have fixed this problem.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><i>11/29/2013:</i> We have increased the recipient limit (maximum number of recipients
                    each email can be sent to) to 2000, to accomodate large lists like ec-discuss.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><i>11/15/2013:</i> We have added more detail to the dryrun results email, such as some
                    example emails that your message will be sent to or not be sent to.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><i>11/14/2013:</i> For fun, we have implemented the xor function
                    <i>for braces notation only</i>, so you can now send to <addr>{list1}^{list2}@simple.mit.edu</addr>.</p>
